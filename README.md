# Lecture Code for CPSC 312

You can access our in-class code for CPSC 312 here. We're going to try to ensure it's also accessible via a forkable REPL that makes it easy to run the code.

## Haskell

If you have a local install of a Haskell compiler, clone the code and run it as you like locally. **Try running files with one of `ghci` (works if you have any packages the set of notes uses installed), `stack ghci`, or `cabal repl`.**

To run on [replit](https://replit.com/~), for the Haskell unit:

1. If you haven't already, make a replit account at https://replit.com/~. (You can use Google, Github, or Facebook integrations for your account. Github is a great choice to make connecting to repos easy.)
2. Go to [Steve's CPSC 312 repl](https://replit.com/@stevenwolfman/cpsc-312-lecture-code) and click the `fork` button. **If your fork adds a number to the name, beware!** So, look for, e.g., `cpsc-312-lecture-code-1` or `cpsc-312-lecture-code-2`. You may need to delete old forks and rename to get the name to simply `cpsc-312-lecture-code`.
3. **Critically**, to run code in the repl, click the "Shell" tab (*not* the Console tab) and run `cd ~/cpsc-312-lecture-code && cabal repl` (or change to the `cpsc-312-lecture-code` and run `cabal repl`).

If you already have the repl and don't want to fork it again to get Steve's latest code, you can try `git pull` in the shell or replit's version control pane on the left to synchronize with https://github.com/steven-wolfman/cpsc-312-lecture-code/.
